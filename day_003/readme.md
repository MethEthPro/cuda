read about the architecture of gpu 

https://cvw.cac.cornell.edu/gpu-architecture/gpu-characteristics/index

refer the above link for some understanding 

also got to know about volta architecture which came with computing capbility 7 in 2017
the latest right now is computing capability 12

SIMT - SINGLE INSTRUCTION MULTIPLE THREADS now , earlier SIMD - SINGLE INSTRUCTION MULTIPLE DATA

A Compute Capability 12.0 SM is a throughput-optimized engine with massive arithmetic resources (e.g., 128 FP32 cores + Tensor Cores), ideal for data-parallel workloads.

A CPU core is a latency-optimized processor built to quickly handle control-heavy and branch-intensive workloads.
